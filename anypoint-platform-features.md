# Anypoint Partner Manager

## What is / Description
Is a low-code integration solution, that enables B2B (business to business) integration over HTTP, but typically uses industry standards to exchange data such as EDI, or AS2, X12 or EDIFACT data.

## Why / Use-case
It's an easy-to-use solution, with a low entry-barrier for all users, that can create integration for specialized use cases that rely on EDIFACT or AS2 formats.
